                <h2><a name="Rules">Rules of Combat</a></h2>
                <p> Othello or Reversi is played by two players, namely the 
Black and the White. They place double sided discs on a board, each disc has 
one of its side colored black and the other white. The player in turn must 
place one disc on the board, with his own color facing up. A disc can only 
be placed if there is an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, 
that are surrounded by your discs. All of the opponent's discs between your 
discs are then flipped up side down to your color. One can capture discs in 
horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines even simultaneously. Thus it is 
possible to flip 18 discs in a single move, tough it is not certain that 
this is advantageous. </p>
               <p>The object of the game is to maximize one's final disccount. 
The player with the most discs is declared the winner. The two players move 
consecutively, if one has no legal moves than he must pass, otherwise moving
is compulsory. The game ends  when there are no legal options for either 
player, this may happen even if the board isn't  filled. </p>
                <p>Unlike in chess, the right for the first move belongs to 
Black, however it is more advantageous to play White. Although the final 
disccount defines the winner, during the game this has no importance what so 
ever.</p>

                <p>Using a simple notation, the black player is noted with the 
plus sign while the white with the minus sign. For example, +d4 means a move 
for the black player on square d4; also, a game value of -34 means an expected 
outcome with a discdifference of 34 discs in the favor of the white player. 
An exclamation point means that a full depth search was performed and the game 
value vas precisely determined. The panel displays some data about the search 
and the game. These are the side in turn, the all moves played to this moment, 
the number of nodes visited during analysis, number of hits in the transposition 
table, the ratio between these two, number of null window research, search 
depth, and some other technical data. <strong>You can safely ignore this panel 
and still enjoy the game!</strong></p>

                <p>You are joking, right? Use the left click to place discs,

<h3><a name="#DoubleMoves">What about that strange board changes?</a></h3>
                <p>Shylock doesn't cheat, double moves are allowed by the rules. 
When the opponent hasn't got any move options then he must pass, therefor 
Shylock can make multiple moves. You can track these by looking at the Info 
Panel's move list. Though the actual rules state that when one hasn't got any 
move options then (s)he must inform the other that (s)he passes, in order to 
reduce the communication overhead between the user, Shylock acts impolitely and 
simply informs you, with a flash of the application window and by an update on 
the Info Panel, that you had no options and he had made a double move. 
Depending on your machine and windows settings you may also hear short beep.</p>
                <h3><a name="#TimeUpdates">How is the remaining time measured?</a></h3>
                <p>Although the Info Panel updates are quite hectic, rest assured 
that the time is measured accurately, since the Info Panel only plays the role of 
an observer and not of a timekeeper.</p>
                <h3><a name="#TimeTrouble">What does it mean "Timed out"?</a></h3>
                <p>It means that Shylock had ran out of its time, thus following 
the spirit of time control you have won. I like challenges, and for this reason 
your time is not accounted for, so Shylock is in a more difficult situation since 
he has to play against an opponent who has unlimited time resources. Of course I 
am not being fair, for taking your chance of a clear victory by not allowing a 
game with equal terms.  As soon as some of the other more urgent problems will 
be solved, an equal time match style will be implemented. Until then try to play 
with more search time like 15 or more minutes, there should be no problems this 
way.</p>
                <h3><a name="OtherPrograms">Other Othello programs</a></h3>
                <p>There are many of them avaible on the net, some are strong 
some are not, some have nice graphics some dont (like Shylock). Perhaps the strongest
Othello program out there is Logistello, who defeated the human world champion by a 
large margin. Programs like Hannibal, Zebra, Keyano, Kitty, TooThought!, Brutus (...) also have an amazing 
strength, some of these programs have versions avaible for download, most dont but you can
play against them and strong humans too, on the GGS (Generic Game Server). It is a generally 
accepted fact that machines are better at Othello than humans players.
