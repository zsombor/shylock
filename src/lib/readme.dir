A bunch of reusable classes, mostly win32 specific( except some CRC related)

NOTE:

  These are mostly from the win32 API tutorials from www.relisoft.com. There is 
a project called WinLib out there with the specific task of encapsulating the
win32 api in a nice and easy to use C++ class set.  You may wish to check the
latest state of WinLib, by using the Code Co-op version control system from 
www.relisoft.com
