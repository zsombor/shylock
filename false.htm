    <h3>My true capabilities in their entire splendor - or am I not an ideal employee?</h3>
<p>I can easily and routinely create miracles, having only meager resources 
at my disposal, for example performances such as writing an operating system 
of mind-blowing complexity, running on top of a toaster oven, for me are 
normal and to be expected. I am impervious to logic errors or bugs of all 
kind, being able to easily eliminate all, simply by casting spells over the 
code. Using the darker side of my craft I can turn financially doomed project 
into what is generally regarded as a textbook case for economic success. </p>
<p>Needless to say I have several years of practitioner's experience in every
programming language, technology and methodology invented, or to be invented 
by mankind. Should the need ever arise, I can assimilate unearthly knowledge 
in comprehensive and swift manner.</p>
<p>Naturally I can schedule my time efficiently, thus in just one day I can 
easily work non-stop 72 hours and still have plenty of time for a rich and 
deeply satisfying social life. Thanks for my blazing speed I can balance 
enormous work loads, whilst still retaining the ability to meet seemingly 
unattainable deadlines.</p>
<p>I have no problems reading technical documentation or programmer's manuals
whatever their quality might be. As a matter of fact thanks to my highly 
developed telepathic sense, I can very well do even without any kind of formal 
specification or documentation. By no means I am limited by any kind of 
natural language barrier, be it swahili, ancient chinese or plain english for 
me it makes no difference whatsoever. </p>
<p>I take a deep and personal enjoyment, by working on all kinds of projects,
however hopeless in their goals or pointless in their essence they might be. 
Similarly I take a great kick out of keeping backward compatibility with old 
legacy software or hardware, regardless their nerve wrecking limitations and 
confusing oddities. As incredible as it may seem I am no more than a mere mortal, 
however should the need ever arise I can very well change into whatever shape 
it might be necessary. </p>
<br>Yours truly,<br>De&eacute; Zsombor
