        <h2>The program.</h2>
            
        <p><strong>Shylock </strong>is an artificial entity, a strong Reversi 
        player a game popularly known as Othello. </p><br>
        
        <p>Shylock's engine uses a self-learned evaluation function, modern 
        algorithms like the MTD(f) invented by Askee Plaat. Move ordering is 
        improved using killer moves, history heuristic, and by iterative deepening 
        with a large transposition table. Also, there is an opening book, 
        containing all known variations.</p>
        
        <p>Shylock is fully object oriented, with an engine written in pure C++, a 
        GUI built with a simple yet powerful OO encapsulation of the Win32 API (no 
        MFC, no OWL, no crap). I've used the advanced concepts presented by 
        Bartosz Milewski in his book <cite>C++ In Action. Industrial Strength 
        Programming Techniques</cite>.</p>

        <h3>Platform requirements.</h3>
        
        <p>This version of Shylock is written for the Win32 platform, thus it can 
        run on Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, Windows 2000 and XP. You will also need 
        a fair amount of RAM; 64 Mb is more than enough, however by changing 
        search options you can get away with 16 Mb or even less.</p></td>

        <p>This project was written explicitly for selfimprovement and since this 
        can't be achieved without feedback I'm inviting you to take a peak into 
        Shylock's source. I hope that you will find it to be readable, understandable
        and generaly enjoyable, so here it is: <a href="latest_source.zip">The Source</a>
        (last update Nov, 2002). For your viewing pleasure you can also download the 
        the doxygen generated <a href="latest_doc.tar.gz">developer's documentation</a>.</p>
        
        <p>You are welcome to download and use the <a href="shylocksetup.zip">binaries</a>
        (last update Nov, 2002). The filesize is motivated mainly by a large amount 
        of precomputed data, the actual executable is quite small. Optionaly there is 
        a an opening book available for download <a href="booksetup.zip">here</a>
        (last update May, 2002), the presence of this file in the install directory 
        will improve the performace of the system. To save your time and bandwidth you 
        may download the <a href="latest_executable.zip">latest executable</a> 
        (last update Nov, 2002) just extract it and replace your previous executable. 
        <strong>Please note</strong> that you must download  the binaries, with the 
        latest executable option you can only do an update of a previous install. Also 
        to obtain a runnable system from the sources you will need some files distributed
        in a binary install.</p></td>
